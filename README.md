## Description

Tamagotchi clone made in Python.

### Prerequisites

Install requirements.txt using "pip install -r requirements.txt"

#### Usage

WINDOWS UNTESTED!

For some reason you must use Sudo to run it on Linux, because of the keyboard module. Likely because it records all keystrokes and not just in the window, which I cannot control.
